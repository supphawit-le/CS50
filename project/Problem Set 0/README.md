The Scratch project "Cat Chases Mouse" is a simple interactive game where the player controls a cat using the arrow keys to chase and catch a randomly moving mouse. The game starts with the mouse appearing at a random position, and the cat moves up, down, left, or right based on the player's input. When the cat catches the mouse, the mouse hides, the player's score increases by one, and the mouse reappears at another random position after a short delay. The game utilizes loops, conditionals, and variables to create an engaging and educational experience. The custom block move sprite [distance] steps allows for flexible movement control, enhancing the player's ability to navigate the cat effectively.
